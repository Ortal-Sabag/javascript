/*
Dynamic typing: 
---------------
you don't tell the engine what type of data a variable holds, it figures it out while your code is running.
variables can hold different types of values because it's all figured out during execution.

Primitive types - definition : 
a type of data that represents a single value.
That is, not an object, not key-value pairs, not a collection of anything.
it just single value.

6 primitive types: 
-----------------
1. undefined: represents lack of existence (you shouldn't set a variable to this value).
2. null: represents lack of existence (you can set a variable to this value).
3. boolean: true or false.
4. number: floating point number (there's always some decimal points).
Unlike other programming languages, there's only one 'number' type in JavaScript and it can make math weird.
5. string: a sequence of characters (both '' and "" can be used).
6. symbol: used in ES6 (the next version of JavaScript) we won't talk about this there...
